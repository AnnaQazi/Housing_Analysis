# 🏠 Housing Price Storytelling - Data Science Assignment

This project is a data storytelling assignment using a housing dataset. The goal was to explore and understand key trends in price, area, and bedrooms through descriptive statistics and visualizations.

We analyzed the distribution, central tendencies, spread, skewness, and outliers in the data to uncover hidden patterns. Insights were summarized in a clear narrative to simulate how a data scientist would communicate findings in a real-world scenario.

## 📊 Key Skills Used:

- Data Exploration (Pandas)
- Statistical Analysis (mean, median, std, skew, kurtosis)
- Visualization (Seaborn & Matplotlib)
- Data Interpretation & Insight Writing
