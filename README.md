# 🏠 Housing Price Storytelling – Data Science Assignment

This assignment was all about data storytelling — not just crunching numbers, but turning them into insights that make sense in the real world. Using a housing dataset, I explored price, area, bedrooms, and categorical features to understand how they shape property values.

I learned how to go beyond raw stats and visualizations by interpreting them in a way that highlights patterns, outliers, and market signals. For example, skewness showed how a handful of luxury properties push prices upward, while categorical features like guestroom or furnishing status revealed clear premium markers.

## 📊 What I Practiced & Learned:

Data Exploration (Pandas) → Cleaning, summarizing, and understanding numerical + categorical variables.

Statistical Analysis → Using measures like mean, median, std, skewness, and kurtosis to interpret distributions.

Visualization (Seaborn & Matplotlib) → Creating scatterplots, boxplots, countplots, and heatmaps to bring stats to life.

Insight Writing → Converting plots into a narrative that explains why the pattern matters.

Storytelling Mindset → Framing results like a data scientist, focusing on the so what? instead of just what.
